They do, however, make distinctions between \"documented\" and \"undocumented\" immigrants. The fact that political correctness bans the term \"illegal immigrant\" highlights the problem. <br/><br/>Mr. Trump long ago stopped saying that he would favor deporting all \"undocumented\" immigrants, realizing no doubt that it would be nigh impossible to do this. But he did, wisely in my view, hold to the belief that we should deport \"undocumented\" immigrants who have criminal records. Inferring that these cities \"understand that not all unauthorized immigrants are criminals,\" tries to give the impression that Mr. Trump does not understand this. He does, and so do his supporters.<br/><br/>To once gain whip up the view that dealing with this issue through enforcement is solely coming from \"nativist ideologues and white nationalists\" is absurd. <br/><br/>I suggest that the NYT editorial board take a nationwide listening tour.
