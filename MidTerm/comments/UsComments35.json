Yet when one pairs this editorial with that on Clinton, one finds that dumping on Trump, however merited, is not matched by well-placed criticism of Clinton' record and character.  By the latter I mean unstoppable ambition,fierceness on military policy, regime change, and support of Wall Street.  In fact, the two candidates are hardly distinguishable--both flawed, neither one to be trusted on matters of state.<br/><br/>Why give credence even to a \"lesser-of-two-evils\" argument, when evil is a bipartisan affliction?  This does not mean, necessarily, go out and support a third party.  It means, speak truth to power and condemn the proceedings as a denial of human rights and democratic government.  An honest position would be to recognize that America is no longer a just polity, and instead, a class-state tipping toward fascism.  Of the two candidates and their supporting parties, both favor wealth concentration, and neither accepts basic principles of international law.<br/><br/>The Times would serve the nation better by admitting the dangers ahead, from a renewed, intensified Cold War to sharpening divisions in domestic wealth and power.  Detraction from Trump is ever so easy, a thoroughly reprehensible figure, but why go from the frying pan into the fire by accepting, or even accommodating to, one as opportunist as Clinton?

He sells confidence and people buy it, despite his catastrophic failures.  FOUR times in bankruptcy, and many more business failures. And his failures have been on the backs of countless small businesses. He refused to honor his payments to them. That is not good for the economy or Americans, but was good for Trump.
