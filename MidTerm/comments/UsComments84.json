Should one state be given this much attention and power by us, the candidates, the pundits, and the polls?  The intense focus and brouhaha makes it seem and feel like by the end of the day, we will have a new president.  The party atmosphere can make us temporarily forget that this is only one tiny step in a grueling process that will take months.<br/><br/>What about the natural herd instinct?  Herd mentality.  Shouldn't that be a concern?  We humans tend to hop on bandwagons to associate with \"winners\" (even temporary winners) without even realizing what we are doing.  If we're not cautious that can override critical thinking and change who we vote for.  For example, it's possible that much of Donald Trump's popularity has to do with this bandwagon state of mind.<br/><br/>To point out another serious imbalance in our election system I, for example, like many of us, live in a Republican state.  So when the time comes, my vote won't count.  That's insane.  Thus, in my opinion, we need to not only make less of what happens in Iowa and New Hampshire but also somehow get rid of gerrymandering and the electoral college and give everyone an equal one person one vote right to choose.

I participated in every caucus except one. There wasn't much point to caucus in 2012!! I love that Iowa is the first in the nation to vote, and the intense attention residents receive from presidential candidates.  There are few places in America that an average person can meet the candidates in the homes of friends &amp; neighbors. It is something that I hope will be preserved for future generations. And the caucuses I've experienced are anything but, boring! Well, at least in the smaller rural communities. The county in which I lived and the 5 surrounding counties had a combined population of just under 50,000 in that 3,000 square mile area!<br/><br/>Having said that, my Yankeedom roots always provided me a nagging sense of disenfranchisement every 4 years. We only caucus for that one office, the president. In many communities there are no buildings with capacity to accommodate all eligible participants for either party. People who work evenings, don't have child care or transportation in mid-winter don't get to participate. Not to mention those who don't want others to know how they voted or a myriad of other reasons people avoid a public, physical participatory process. On the other hand, I never heard any of those people even discuss, let alone complain, about it. <br/><br/>Iowa IS a place of extremes!

Yes, much of this country is rural as well; look out the window of the plane as you dismiss it as flyover country.
