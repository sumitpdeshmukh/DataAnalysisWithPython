For someone who suffered the worst of war - and not a righteous war at that - it confounds me that he continues to never meet a war he hasn't liked.  What lessons has he learned that he is so quick to send the best of our country off to wars that make no sense.

In wars that no one knows who the good guys are and what the goals are.<br/><br/>Barack Obama constantly gets criticized by the right for not showing leadership in foreign affairs - to them leadership means leading our troops into war.
