Until you sit in the hot seat, you can claim to make all the right calls.  When your decisions affect the lives of millions of people, those decision become a little harder.  There are lots of sideline coaches who've won championships, but very few in practice who do.  At least Bernie is honest enough to admit that he doesn't know.  And I think these candidates have told us how they would handle foreign problems, at least stylistically, which is probably the most important factor.  Can there be any doubt how Donald Trump would handle a foreign policy situation, based on the way he handles problems with his campaign now? I think the same could be said for all the others.  At least with Bernie we can trust he'll handle things on the up and up and look out for the interests of common citizens of all countries.

As we move away from fossil fuels, our interest will move away as well. Certain factions within Islam greatly have resented our opportunistic meddling in the region. This is framed as a sort of holy war in response to the actions of the West.<br/><br/>Since 9/11 and the beyond idiotic invasion of Iraq, what have we got for all the resources we have devoted to war? A small group, Al Qaeda, was disrupted. However, its influence spread and morphed around the region into a regional conflict that has toppled governments, displaced and murdered millions, and cost trillions (put terms Americans can relate to.) <br/><br/>All our interventionism has taken a relatively contained problem and turned it in to a humanitarian and international crisis of epic proportion. The unintended consequences have been enormous.  <br/><br/>Isis is a fight for control of Islam as were the European conflicts during the Reformation when Catholics murdered Protestants and vice versa. Islam staid out of that.<br/><br/>I agree with Bernie and those foreign policy experts who say we have to act with forethought and with allies to confront the bloodshed and barbarity while looking for ways to calm the situation.

Why don't journalists and pundits ask Clinton not about her Benghazi emails, but about her original support of the Libya debacle in the first place and why she can't embrace and defend the successful pact and detente with Iran?
