The judge's ethnicity or Trump's claim thereof is of only minimal moment. This judge was confirmed by the Senate and serves in accordance with Article III.  While a political leader may be critical of a sitting judge's previous decisions, such a person may not criticize a judge because of and during a current case before the court and certainly not concerning a case before the court in which he or she is a party.  The ludicrous opinions proffered by some that this is the same as a President's potential nominations of a federal judge are outrageously and offensively off the mark:  this is not about a nomination, rather, this issue is about respecting the authority of the judiciary as an independent body.  Trump has gained the vote of the many who are outraged by their treatment by a non-caring and self-dealing body of elected officials from the local to the federal level.  So be it; but to ridicule and parade effrontery in this matter are the stuff of those confusing the rule of law with the rule of the mob.  There is a social contract in our country:  the majority wins, the majority agrees to consider the legitimate issues of the minority, and there is an expectation that differences over time will be balanced.
