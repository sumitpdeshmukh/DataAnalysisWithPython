Their catastrophic agenda comes from their insistence that they are \"history's actors\", and that they \u201ccreate [their] own reality.\u201d You insist on studying this like detectives raking cold ashes while the arsonist who set that fire sets ten more. <br/><br/>How obtuse is the Times? Of course Jeb Bush \u201cdid not begin to address the hard questions\u201d. Of course Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cinspire confidence as a possible international leader\u201d. Of course their entire party offers nothing but \u201cvague, disjointed ideas, mostly on the Mideast and disconnected from a coherent strategy and even sometimes from reality\u201d. They will never satisfy your feeble calls for responsibility or reason or civility because\u2014as an explicit policy--they abandoned responsibility and reason and civility long ago, with nothing but blood to show for it, and they revel in your ongoing befuddlement that they aren\u2019t responsible or reasonable or civil about kicking your teeth in again.<br/><br/>They are nihilists, traitors and vandals.
