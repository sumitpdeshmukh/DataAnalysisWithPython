Clinton's decline has to do with further waves of false equivalence between the two candidates. Trump's campaign, again, seems to be one step ahead of the media and the Clinton campaign.

Historically, it is a demographic that votes reliably. In contrast, Clinton needs to mobilize young voters and lower-income minority voters. These demographics vote in small numbers historically, and is often the target of voter suppression.<br/><br/>So Trump doesn't need to re-brand or change himself. He and his campaign simply relentlessly attack Clinton. His surrogates continuously encourage false equivalence between Trump and Clinton, and the mainstream media obligingly plays along. This is all to make sure enough people hate Clinton enough to stay home on election day.
