Its top guy, and the select power group around him, is afraid of the West, of its free press, democracy, and justice.  Afraid that the same thing could happen there as it has to other similar regimes such as those of Saddam Hussein and Muammar al-Gaddafi. If they were to step down and the Russian people would finally be able to take back their freedoms and democracy, they would no doubt face justice. So to stay in power, the regime lies to and cheats the Russian people, and provokes and threatens the west. The theats are made out of weakness and fear, like a wounded and scared animal. It shows clearly that Russia is not strong, it is weak. But it is still very dangerous for European and world peace, not least due to its nuclear arsenal and its large army and navy at Europe's borders, which clearly threaten especially the Baltic states, combined with the total unpredictability of the current leadership which seems to need conflicts to justify their positions. <br/><br/>NATO's response is therefore appropriate, because the only message that's understood is military strength.   <br/><br/>Russia's leadership should, and probably do, understand that NATO is a defensive organisation only, comprising a large number of countries none of which would ever want a war against Russia, so NATO in itself poses no threat to Russia and would never threaten it, as long as Russia itself stays peaceful.
