Not only were most whom I met unaware of the law being passed, but that it was put on hold by one judge.  Let me tell you, it got attention from trump voters I encountered. And surprisingly, we had conversations not fights.  They saw they were being cheated and were interested.<br/><br/>In a world where we do not all read the same news it is essential that everyone who made up the popular vote point out to the people who voted for trump the impact of their actions every day--personally.  It's NOT an \"I told you so\" kind of thing. Most of the people I encounter really don't follow the news at all because it's too upsetting and confusing or are hardened into their views through the impact of their family and friends.<br/><br/>It's not up to politicians.
