Both men ran election platforms which resembled one another; the main point being an anti-Trump campaign to keep Trump from receiving the Republican nomination. The voters who had intended on voting for Rubio are now left with a choice of who to back up. The choice, being between Kasich and Cruz, comes down to choosing the candidate who has the best chance at defeating Trump. Though Kasich is a viable candidate, he is too far behind in the polls to effectively defeat Trump overall. Therefore, the choice is evident that voters must choose Cruz. <br/><br/>It's also important to examine the population that did vote for Trump: the uneducated. A group of individuals who cannot discern the truth from Trumps lies, or understand when Trump has no idea what he is talking about. Rather they vote for him simply because they've heard his name before, because he is famous. The typical Trump supporter cannot give a single valid reason as to why Trump should become the President of the United States; most don't even know what issues the man stands for. However, as the election has progressed, some of these people have become aware of the issues and the policies, and removed themselves from that uneducated minority to join the populous under Cruz.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1459971340", "commentID": 18133865, "userID": 74942105, "recommendations": 5, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 18133865}, {"approveDate": "1459970982", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1459967382", "permID": "18133427", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 3, "replies": [{"approveDate": "1460010873", "commentType": "userReply", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1460007273", "permID": "18133427:18134633", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": "Cleo", "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 2, "userLocation": "Miami", "parentID": 18133427, "userDisplayName": "acm", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "I'd prefer Trump to Cruz.
