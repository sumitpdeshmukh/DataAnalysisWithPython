Smalltown has a football club that is the town's pride and joy. Mr Smith comes to town. He has no interest in football, has never played it, never watched it, and knows nothing about the game's history or its arcane rules. <br/><br/>Mr Smith, who is a very rich real estate salesman, notices however that the club is located on a prime piece of real estate, high on the cliff tops overlooking the Pacific, which he thinks would provide an ideal setting for a new international 5-star hotel, casino and golf course.<br/><br/>Mr Smith joins the club which initially welcomes him as a member. Mr Smith then runs for President of the club at the next AGM. To ensure he has the numbers, he persuades a large number of his employees to join the club beforehand.<br/><br/>Mr Jones is a lifelong member of the club. He played football at a high level when he was young, and has devoted his life to the club, raising funds to buy the land on which the club sits, building the clubhouse, painting and decorating it over many decades.<br/><br/>Mr Jones is suspicious of Mr Smith's motives, and because he knows the rule book backwards, having helped to write it, he succeeds in having the votes of Mr Smith's  supporters declared invalid, on the grounds that they joined the club too late in the club's electoral cycle to be able to vote.<br/><br/>The Republican Party and the Democrats are political clubs.
