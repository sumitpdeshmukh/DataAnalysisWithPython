The next administration is going to simply frame this issue as a project that creates more jobs. The is a lose lose proposition for the Democrats who oppose this. In the current  economic and political climate if the debate is Jobs vs Environment...then jobs will win hands down...every time. Trump will argue oil drilling technology has improved over the years reducing the impact of the wells on the environment....which is true. The biggest piece of evidence supporting this is it's already being done in other parts of Alaska. Animals and oil drilling have coexisted for years all over the northern parts of Alaska.  While oil from Arctic Circle might take a couple of years to get online, the job creation and effect on the economy would be almost instantaneous, as infrastructure and development activity could start immediately, sending billions to the federal government and employing thousands of people.
