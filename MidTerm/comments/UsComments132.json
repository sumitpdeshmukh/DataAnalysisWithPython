Regardless of how important, vital, critical an issue is, if they can't determine completely how it is solved according to their ideology, the answer is no. Obstruction is their only response, because they are negative by nature.<br/><br/>2) Obama has displayed compassion, sensitivity and wisdom in complete contrast to Republicans in the legislative branch. He is an obviously good, decent, rational person, one with a wonderful family. So, he is a role model that normal people can appreciate and approve of, whereas Republicans keep on giving the gift of just saying no while spending what little effort they bring to their job playing the hungry for power game every day.
