It could have been written by one of the Dulles brothers. It consists mostly of made up \"facts\" and omissions. There is, as far as I know, no evidence that anyone associated with the Russian government hacked Podesta's emails. Nor did Russia act unilaterally to annex Crimea or start a was in eastern Ukraine. It did so only after the US engineered the overthrow of a democratically elected president in Kiev and installed a right wing puppet, who, by the way, threatened the autonomy of the Russian speaking region in the east. As to bombing civilians in Syria, there is nothing any proponent of US foreign policy can say about this that isn't laughably hypocritical . Over the past 15 years, since our entry into Afghanistan, it's been a good day when the US hasn't bombed civilians including clearly marked hospitals and wedding parties.. It's also worth noting that almost immediately after the US and Russia agreed to cooperate in Syria, the US attacked a column of Syrians regulars , thus scuttling the deal that the Pentagon publicly rejected. Putin's supposed expansionary vision comes down to this:  resist the forward march of US hegemony. Other than the US's  European vassals, most other countries agree. I don't know what Trump will do, but a foreign policy that relies on negotiation rather than relentless military posturing and the continued invasion of countries throughout the Middle East might be worth a try.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1479056759", "commentID": 20470997, "userID": 64598120, "recommendations": 110, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 20470997}, {"approveDate": "1479060305", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1479060305", "permID": "20470982", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "oakland, ca", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "drew van zee", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Shame on the NY Times!

By continuing the saber rattling, the US is greatly increasing the odds that Putin's successor will be a danger both to his own people and the US, and indeed to the world. Putin is no boy scout, but he is rational and pragmatic. Yes, he looks out for the interests of his country; that is his job. Yes, he is strategic and calculating, as any leader needs to be, but he is not crazy. By continuing to put fear and anger in the hearts of the Russian people, the US is helping to set the stage for someone far less restrained to take control in Russia. Is it worth the danger, just to keep the money flowing to our bloated military industrial complex? Think fearful, angry people will not vote into office someone who promises to address their fears and anger, even though their choice might put their country at risk in other ways?
