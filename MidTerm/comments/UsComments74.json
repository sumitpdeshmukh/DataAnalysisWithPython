Everyone agrees though: Pence will help Trump get elected.  The rest is basically a list of his positions on various issues and spinning them as negatively as possible.  <br/><br/>Hey, he signed legislation against gender-based discrimination.  One would expect that would at least make the NYT happy, concede as much.  Who cares how he got there?  What matters is that he's demonstrated the ability to listen and compromise in favor of liberals, despite his own personal convictions.  A rare quality on both sides of the aisle these days. <br/><br/>This has got to be the most grudging endorsement of any candidate in NYT history.  It almost feels like high hopes were placed on Trump messing-up his Veep choice and dooming his campaign.  Aka wishful thinking, now confirmed dashed.  To the contrary, worst fears have been realized: a VP choice unquestionably smart, one who'll pick apart the opposition both in debates and also in office, one who'll propel Trump to the WH and much more beyond that.<br/><br/>In other words, Pence appears to have reinforced on the NYT, the long-denied inevitability of Trump getting elected.  All the say-it-ain't-soing aside, a endorsement is what this opinion really is, for both Pence, and by extension, his boss, for picking him.
