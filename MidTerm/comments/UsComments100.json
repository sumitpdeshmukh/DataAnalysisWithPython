Similarly, he wants to de-emphasize the excessive regulation we have imposed on our industry and commerce for the entirety of the Obama administration, that has cost us economic growth and middle-class jobs. Finally, he sympathizes with the arguments of labor that our trade arrangements are unbalanced to the favor of our trading partners while they damage our own vital interests.<br/><br/>He won't lose a single vote that was up for the taking for these positions, and may attract a ton of votes that without this speech might have gone to Mrs. Clinton.<br/><br/>Leave the country isolated from the world? In point of fact, no -- our corporate taxes are among the very highest in the industrialized world, make us uncompetitive and incentivize our companies to bolt; our regulation is stifling expansion and job-creation; and free trade policies have played their role, along with offshoring and automation, in hollowing-out our middle classes.
