The positives for Clinton over Trump however is that for most part she has not made statements that have disparaged or discouraged people because of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation like Trump has. That I think has caused her and the Democrats to relax with the feeling that this will be a cake walk but as the polls now show this probably wont be and she and the Democratic special interest groups need to start hitting hard now. Do it before the GOP convention and put doubt in this nominee rather than wait till after the convention and he has momentum.

They can't win, they can only be destructive. Recently it's been suggested that Clinton will own the nomination before California polls close -- New Jersey polls will close first. It will be over then. The notion that superdelegates supporting Hillary will switch short of Sanders winning a majority of pledged delegates is absurd. The inability of Berniebots to understand that Hillary has taken virtually all the states which represent large population centers as well as Florida and Ohio, is, as they say, mind-boggling.<br/><br/>Finally, Bernie's running well against Trump but Bernie hasn't had to deal with a Republican onslaught yet. NO Republican wants to attack Bernie now. They want him to do as much damage to Hillary as possible. <br/><br/>Sanders voters insistently point to his running ahead with Independents. Yes, but he's running far, far, far behind with Democrats. This is the nominee of the Democratic party. Everyone fears Bernie supporters staying.

It was supposed to be a cakewalk, but it isn't.  <br/><br/>The mistake that the establishment parties and their corporate backers made was that they got to overtly greedy, too obviously contemptuous of the people of this country.  The jig is up in the eyes of millions of disaffected, struggling Americans.  They've heard more than their fill of false promises.  They've watched this theatre of the absurd many times over.  All the canned responses, the calculation, the outright lies.  They've seen the rich and corporate America scoop up all the gains of the \"recovery.\"  Watched the \"liberal\" Obama cater to the banks and bail them out while they were foreclosed on and their children buried under mountains of student debt.  Worked the gig jobs and struggled to pay the rent.  <br/><br/>Sanders didn't cause any of this. He's an easy target, but he's not the cause of HRCs difficulties.  Without him, people would have stayed home and tuned out in disgust like they did in 2010 and 2014, and she would have limped along to the finish line.
