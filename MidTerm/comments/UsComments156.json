The bank did not want to help. The tarp funds available were not even close to being within reach. No financial fraudster,s were held accountable. This country poured trillions down the drain to help Afghanistan and Pakistan who cannot help their own people, but were adept at helping  themselves to our blood and especially treasure. The senate and congress is nothing more than a special good ol boys club harnessed to all the special interests this country is willing to offer. I mean, COME ON! How long is this form of governance going to continue to rot from the inside out. The most obvious such as global warming, excessive firearms, general paranoia fed by our vaunted news sources and a sense that it's every family for themselves does not even register to anybody, anywhere,anytime. It no longer feels like the usual suspects are any different or will do anything any different than the former suspects.
