The risk is obvious given how he links his wealth -and now his election win- to his grandiosity. However, I think that this editorial misses another reason why foreign nations might want to pay Donald Trump a favor: as a cost-effective insurance against his bad character.<br/><br/>As a business man, Donald Trump has all the appearance of an untrustworthy, profit-seeking bully who splits the world in pure black and white and who seems seems oblivious to the subtle and the complex. So much for conventional diplomacy. Foreign nations may simply want to buy a form of insurance against the unpredictability of a bully who has access to the power of the mightiest nation on Earth. This would seem a very reasonable step to do. His conflicts of interest and his character definitely ask - no, beg - for corruption and flattery.<br/><br/>Who wouldn't prefer to conclude a discussion with president Trump like the New York Times last week? \"The  is a great, great jewel.
