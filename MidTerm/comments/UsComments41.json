We have McCain, Ryan and McConnell castigating Trump for his blatant racism. This makes for interesting articles but these people all only have one vote.

This is not about the Republican leadership but about the Republican citizens who exercised their constitutional privilege of voting. My question is why have they voted for Mr. Trump, a narcissistic skin thin individual who makes fun of others for his own benefit.
