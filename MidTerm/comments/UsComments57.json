The Leave campaign here was passionate in their lies and a few key political headline adverts became impossible to circumvent: Make Britain Great Again, Take Back Our County, \u00a3350 million More for the NHS, Don't let Brussels Make Our Laws. Our version of Trump, Boris Johnson, won the day. His personality and larger than life persona won the argument and yet today he is disgraced so quickly after the referendum.
