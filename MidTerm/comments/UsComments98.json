The underlying discontent with Obama's new rules is not the rules in and of themselves, it is the way these same rules have been attempted over the last 20 years. The erosion factor. I don't believe that there are many gun owner who oppose background checks. What they oppose is the gradual erosion of their rights over a period of years. Think of it this way. each time a politician has tried to enable sweeping gun legislation, he or she has been shot down by the majority of Americans. So, these same politicians try a different tact, they move on a tiny piece of legislation and succeed. They couldn't consume the cookie in one bite, but after many tiny bites the cookie is still gone. In the end, what the gun owners are telling you is that none of these controls will end violence on the streets of America as the government has done NOTHING to disarm the criminal element. What the liberal element fails to realize is that a criminal will not knowingly walk into an environment knowing that the other party is armed. If Obama and these other politicians want to succeed, make facilities available to the general public that teach firearm safety and proper use. No, you won't see immediate improvement - as the populace is generally distrustful of the government and the police - but over time, it will work.
