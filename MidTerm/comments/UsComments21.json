It all reeks of the same loyalty shown by a physically abused mate who rationalizes that the abuser is really a good person who cares about them. So if nothing can convince Trump supporters to open their eyes, then can he do anything as a president that might change their tune? Suppose he issued an executive order to round up Moslems and put them in internment camps? Suppose he called on the military to transport 11 million people south of the border, dropping them off in the desert to make their way home. Would they criticize him then? What will they say when his trade barriers bring down the economy? Or suppose all those white supremacist groups that love him so much (they understand his real appeal) felt emboldened enough to grow their numbers and start exerting their influence in ways that put all minorities in jeopardy? At what point do his supporters realize the America he has made great again no longer holds any of the values that makes America great. The fact is they won\u2019t. They will love him even more. This is the scariest thing of all. They won\u2019t be any better off, but most of them (the white ones at least) will feel their role has shifted from being abused to being the abuser.

First, he does not stop to consider the popularity of his points of view before offering them. When most of the rest of the Republican party is happy to make it difficult for transgender people to use a public bathroom in the south, Trump demonstrates he's not a \"true Republican\" by saying that everyone should decide for themselves what is the appropriate bathroom to use. No hidden agenda!!! And second, by using a megaphone instead of a dog whistle, he has shown the world how at least one third of the Republican party is crass, bigoted, deeply racist, unabashedly ignorant, mean and just plain angry. <br/><br/>If the Republicans want to be an effective, vital political party, they have to change. Instead of wasting $trillions when in power and grinding government to a halt when Democrats are, they need to demonstrate effective leadership by working with Democrats to achieve the best possible outcome for all Americans.

Just a lot of posturing and pandering to lure this or that group into the fold, only to be recalibrated by the puppetmasters - themselves replaceable if their strategies aren't working - as the process evolves. And, of course, there's no accountability to the voting public whatsoever. You can promise the moon, and then renege once you get into office. At worst, you're approval rating might slip down a few points.<br/><br/>I said \"for the most part\" above, because there's one candidate this time around who does not fit into this model, who's as real as a politician can be, and that's Bernie Sanders. Not only has Bernie's message been consistent for the entire campaign, it's the same message he's been espousing for his entire political career. One can question whether his goals are achievable or not, but there's no question that he's genuinely dedicated to achieving them, and that he truly represents the interests of average citizens. The contrast between him and charlatans like Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton, is as stark as it gets. He's our only hope for desperately needed meaningful change right now, and his loss in the campaign would be a true loss for the nation. If only more people could see it.
