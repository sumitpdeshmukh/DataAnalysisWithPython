I think Fox and friends,  including most of the current Republican candidates, have been committed to preaching and teaching good ole' masculine hatred (not feminine fear). It's always reassuring, even comforting,  to join a team and attack the opposition. I, a liberal, am newly inspired with hot hatred of Sarah Palin (since she blamed Obama for her son's assault on his girlfriend). It's the season. That said, the loathsome, cocky, xenophobic, tribal messages preached by Trump and Cruz (Ted, who shared the stage with a pastor calling for the execution of all gay U.S. citizens) are so mean and crude and empty they're incredible ... meaning \"not credible.\" Can't believe it.
