BCBS decided NOT to participate in the healthcare market exchange, and now their plans are to begin in 2017, they say. United Healthcare entered the Iowa exchange market but with great reluctance and hesitation. Now they say that they will leave the exchange in 2017.<br/><br/>It has been apparent to many that United Healthcare did not want to see ACA succeed, in Iowa or anywhere. The largest healthcare company has an agenda against ACA, and they are using their clout to do so. They claim that they're losing money and ACA will just fail (they hope).<br/><br/>There was a healthcare co-op, CoOpportunity Health that started at the intro of ACA. Well, it turned out that the business for Coop Healthcare was too good for them. They were flooded with more applicants than they had predicted. They got the folks in the greatest need for remedial and immediate action. But they ran out of money, because they attracted too many people.<br/><br/>So now Iowa has ONE provider for ACA. Yes, they have to follow the ACA laws. But are they, Coventry Health, division of Aetna Insurance, committed to the health of ACA? No. These companies still wield too much power. They have an interest to see ACA fail. They are doing their damnedest to see, all hidden and behind the scenes, that ACA fails.
