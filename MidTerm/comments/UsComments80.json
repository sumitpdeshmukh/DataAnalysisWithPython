Just as with Christians there are some who deeply observant in their religious beliefs and traditions, many who are casual or convenient, and some whose perspectives or behavior have nothing to do with the faith they presumably hold. Ms. Kim Davis has performed a public service by asserting she is a Christian while demonstrating a wide range of behavior and attitudes inconsistent with Christianity. Yet for some reason political leaders, public figures, and pundits imply all Muslims demonstrate a deep religiosity and  promotion of their faith that threaten the rest of us. By that test the United States is doomed as the country is overrun by Christian fanatics, not populated by people nominally identified as Christians but who are also Rotarians, engineers, Texans, scout leaders, skiers, soccer fans, stockholders, ex-felons, birders, etc. Why is it that our multiple identities convey an acceptable pluralism  but one segment is identified solely on religious grounds in a way seen as unacceptable.

He said, quite simply, that he is bewildered by the fact that it has become so important again. Fifty or 100 years ago, world affairs were driven by other ideas and religion had faded into the background, into private and social life, where it belongs. Now, rather suddenly, religion has made a huge comeback in both national and world affairs, and it's not a welcome change if you ask Mr. Rushdie (or me). <br/><br/>As for Ben Carson, it is important to keep in mind that he is an avowed Creationist who believes, quite literally, that the theory of evolution is the devil's handiwork. He sees the human brain and all its trillions of synaptic connections as a perfectly ordered system. Since, in his view, the universe is already perfectly ordered, he must believe he has a defined (divined?) place within that order, and evidently this place involves joining a highly elite club including some of the most powerful humans in history. Whether he wins or loses is, of course, is dependent on the will of God, like all things. <br/><br/>I cannot relate in any way to this mindset. I do not understand how a neurosurgeon can believe any such thing, but evidently some do. I think his beliefs are absurd and I am concerned that such absurdity influences the laws of society. <br/><br/>But I also know one other thing: Ben Carson is still qualified to be president.
