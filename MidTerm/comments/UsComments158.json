Regardless of what the interval is, Trump's Civis numbers is an incredible win for him.  Let's assume Trump's true numbers intervals between, say, 13 to 19, with 16 as the mean. Do you see the REAL news here?  It's not Carson, but rather it's Bush.  If Bush's numbers have a similar 3 points interval, say 6 to 12 with 9 as the mean, then that definitively spells **early** trouble for Bush, because the non-overlapping nature of Trump's and Bush intervals says in no uncertain terms that Trump's lead over Bush is a **statistically significant** edge at this **early** juncture. Not just a survey sampling error aberration, but a statistically significant difference, among registered Republicans no less.  That means that, at this early juncture, with the Civis report there is now definitive survey evidence that Bush's message has no traction. Evidence of it gaining traction at all? Editor, you need to rewrite the article analyzing Civis' numbers not just against natl popularity polls but on a stand-alone basis.  Looked at this way, at this juncture, findings are incredibly Trump favorable and Bush unfavorable.  The question now for Bush is two fold: what must he do to get **more than** his pro rata share of the undecided 24, for he can't be satisfied with just his pro rata share cuz that only locks in his sub position. And, how can he capture votes of candidates who drop out?", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1440660284", "commentID": 15907100, "userID": 5502121, "recommendations": 13, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 15907100}, {"approveDate": "1440684578", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1440680978", "permID": "15910022", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Middle", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Franklin", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Time to pull The Authoritarian Personality off the shelf and give it another read.  <br/><br/>Like many commentators, I'm less troubled by Trump than by the people who are finding something inspirational, something they can identify with, in his performance.
