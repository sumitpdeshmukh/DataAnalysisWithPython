What the liberal, agenda-driven pundits at the NY Times and their followers and like-minded ilk fail to understand is that this election is really not about Republicans and Democrats.

That can only mean that everyone's afraid to put Trump signs on their yards, but in private discussions, many have told me \"we're not voting Hillary - and likely won't vote at all\".  <br/><br/>I think secretly, many here in CA are going to hit the Trump button.

People keep blaming the education system but when one looks at Trump's rallies there is an awful lot of boomers in the audience. How many generations back do we keep scapegoating teachers and our education system. I'm 57.  Many of my teachers are dead. Are they still blamed for this willful ignorance of an angry electorate that doesn't even know what it is angry about? I keep reading that the median income of Trump supporters is around 80K. Hardly the poor and \"disenfranchised\" I keep hearing about. To quote Steve Earle \"you have two of everything but you think that you are down and out.\" Most of my friends are Trump supporters. None are anywhere near poor and some are quite financially well off. I don't know what drives their anger. I do know that they stubbornly support their candidate and totally dismiss any evidence that tarnishes his image. They are very quiet in their defense, almost like they are embarrassed by defending the indefensible but they still will vote for the indefensible hate-filled Trump. The willful ignorance is frightening. Does their inability to admit they were conned overcome their ability to do what is right for our country? Will they vote for this despot out of stubborn pride?", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1471778074", "commentID": 19553164, "userID": 57543070, "recommendations": 143, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19553164}, {"approveDate": "1471789496", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1471785896", "permID": "19553309", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Austin", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Kevin", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Before we satisfy ourselves that this dark cloud is going to safely drift by, I think it would be wider to wait until election day to start making plans about \"recovery\".", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1471779052", "commentID": 19553309, "userID": 12285180, "recommendations": 70, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19553309}, {"approveDate": "1471794429", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1471878278", "permID": "19554900", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "USA", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "dbb", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Let's be fair:  many, not all, from the dust bowl, rust belt, and Appalachia saw factories outsourced to include to Mexico ... many, not all, locals lost many of the few remaining jobs to illegal immigrants -- again many, not all-- coming from Mexico, and along with the impact on local culture and schools, etc. Locals raised concerns but were labeled bigots and racists.
