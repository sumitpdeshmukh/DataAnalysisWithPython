It\u2019s that we believe that the illegal aliens protected in these sanctuaries don\u2019t belong here because they broke our laws to enter and remain. We reject this curious notion on the left of the propriety of osmotic movements of people across frontiers to seek some kind of economic balance across continents. We attach value to our culture, and see a threat to allowing in unmanageable numbers from other cultures and eventually allowing them to vote based on values that haven\u2019t yet been assimilated.<br/><br/>The sanctuary city movement clearly is maintained by people who wish to open our borders to all comers, in any numbers.

There is no question that immigration policy falls within federal jurisdiction.  If this defiance of federal authority gains acceptance, on what grounds would anyone be able to challenge states that  decided to ignore the SC ruling on same sex marriage or imitated Arizona and enacted a state immigration law harsher than the policy of the federal government?<br/><br/>At its heart, this defiance of federal jurisdiction with respect to immigration resembles the nullification movement of the early 19th century.  John C. Calhoun and the state government of South Carolina, anxious preserve slavery against any federal interference, developed the theory that states had the authority to reject enforcement of federal laws they considered in violation of the Constitution.  San Francisco and other cities are not claiming the legal right to defy federal authority, but in practice that is what they are doing. <br/><br/>The impasse over immigration reform has created a tragic dilemma for illegal immigrants and their supporters.
