As the mother of a 9-year-old who has spent the last year learning about what it means to be a refugee thanks to his excellent public school teacher, I say all third graders should learn about the refugee crisis.

The immigration that we cite, Ellis Island, was supported (and restricted) by an ocean.  It was not made of porous \"guest worker\" migrants, and it was not the result of a resettlement policy born of genocide.  We are in uncharted waters, so it is fair and reasonable for people to disagree with approach.<br/><br/>If we are to continue to thrive as a nation, we need to agree on a few principles.  First, we will never be able to accommodate as many displaced people as our hearts ask of us.  As the world's richest nation, that supply will be inexhaustible.  Second, America continues only when an immigrant sheds a certain amount of \"independence\" and becomes part of the \"melting pot\".  The voguish hyphenation trend is anathema to that requirement.  Finally, the country has no responsibility to \"enable\" any policies that work against assimilation.  Immigration must be founded on integration, language acquisition, and expectation of immediate contribution to the common good.<br/><br/>We are a country of open hearts.  However, we do our current citizens, going through tectonic economic shifts, no favors when we treat immigration as some parlor game among the intellectual class.<br/><br/>Immigration is our future.

Five years ago some of the Syrians seeking refuge were well settled in the cradle of civilization and would never have thought they would meet this desperate fate. Western powers changed their plight by supporting and arming the rebels in an attempt to depose the Syrian dictator Assad, I met a Swiss citizen during my recent visit to the Nordic countries and he was upset about the large influx of North African refugees in his country and he blamed the invasion of Iraq by Bush as a cause for refugee influx. I agree that invasion of Iraq was a blunder but to associate the current epic refugee migration cannot be linked totally to the Iraq invasion. Instead it can be associated with the Arab spring in Libya, Yemen, Syria fueled by the then secretary of state Sec. Clinton and members of US congress.
