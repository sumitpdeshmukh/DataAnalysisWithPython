The origin of this \"predicament\" began in the 1990's when the GOP began re-building its \"foundation\" by courting the most conservative (far-right) sectors of the electorate.  This foundation was cultivated and cemented by the surging presence of conservative radio talk shows across the air waves...throughout the entire country.  This, with the help of local Gerrymandering of the House of Representative seats in conservative-leaning states, created a newly-founded GOP base which is virtually \"unchallenged\" in areas of the country.<br/>The obvious effect of these developments succeeded in moving the GOP foundation from being a Center/Center-Right Party to one even further to the Right.  In the process, the GOP has consolidated its status as a \"minority\" Party for the Presidential (i.e. General) Elections.  Under these circumstances, it will be very difficult for ANY Republican nominee to win a Presidential Election.  The Electoral College votes simply don't exist for the GOP if the so-called Red States are to be relied upon for winning Elections.
