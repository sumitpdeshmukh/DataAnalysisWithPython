(Quite a bit of repair work to do on behalf of our country, which apparently she succeeded at.) <br/><br/>So she continued to use her existing email server, which she had used as a Senator, and her husband had used as a former President, apparently without any security problems for either of them, and which she knew worked well - as opposed to the State Department's archaic technology.<br/><br/>Apparently, she broke no laws in doing so. It was not illegal to do so. And it looks like there were no significant security breaches linked to her email use. (I think we would have heard from the FBI by this time if there were.) <br/><br/>Did Mrs. Clinton represent the interests of the United States competently and helpfully as Secretary of State? Most people thought so, if polls taken at the time of her service were accurate. <br/><br/>Why, then, is her use of a private email server now seen as the defining characteristic of her service as SoS, when it did not have any negative consequences?<br/><br/>I trust her.

I would challenge anyone to name one federal government official that doesn't wish to keep their personal messages private. They do have a legal right to do so, just like the rest of us.

Corporate employees often need to carry two devices, while executives are frequently rendered exempt by their own decree. She asked, her staff simply executed.  Who would question the head of the State Department in any administration? That said, it was a mistake for her to do it. She admitted that long ago. What it was not, is illegal. No grand conspiracy is in play. There are hundreds of thousands of private servers in homes across the country. They are not exotic nor mysterious. The press sometimes makes it sound like some kind of sinister laboratory operating in the Clinton basement. Until this story arose, many other nameless politicians were also likely using private email. Some probably own servers. They certainly won't admit to that now.
