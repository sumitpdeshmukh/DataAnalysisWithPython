Even Pres. Obama has stayed away from it as political poison and had no anti-poverty program (never even heard him address the issue).<br/><br/>Also, the poor are considered unlikely to vote, so why waste time of them.  Now all of sudden it appears the poor will actually vote (really?).  Doubts about that and their absolute number still make it a possible sub-optimal issue to focus on.  Plus it seems to \"bring the energy down in the room\" for some people who would rather focus on success, growth, opportunity and all that \"positive\"stuff.  The poor as an issue just doesn't poll well (sad but true).<br/><br/>Americans also often want to blame the victim (the poor are that way because they did something wrong and thus they got what they deserve). it is only now that a few people are beginning to acknowledge that we have systems that create poverty and shift wealth and income upwards.  Neither candidate has a real deep plan for this (tax increases, desegregation of schools, stronger union and organizing rights).  Maybe HRC comes the close, but this is where the trust issue comes in (she, like Obama are too close to the Goldman Sachs crowd).", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4316/6780/cropped-43166780.jpg?10158482351685310151", "createDate": "1473883464", "commentID": 19796719, "userID": 43166780, "recommendations": 15, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19796719}, {"approveDate": "1473886476", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1473882876", "permID": "19796681", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "TPS_Reports", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Well for one thing, it's hard for Hillary to pivot from her promise to broaden Obama's Executive Action to shield illegal immigrants from deportation and then start talking about how she wants to help The Poor.<br/><br/>The Poor are fighting each other for that single dishwashing job, and now they have some additional competition from another 6-7 million people who are willing to do that job for less. <br/><br/>From a 1995 GAO report (link below): \"GAO found that: (1) illegal aliens in the United States generate more in costs than revenues to federal, state, and local governments combined; (2) estimates of the national net cost of illegal aliens vary greatly, ranging from $2 billion to $19 billion.\" <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/221495.pdf\" title=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/221495.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/221495.pdf</a><br/><br/>And that was 20 years ago; in the report they estimated 3.5 - 4 million illegal immigrants in the US at that time.

Poverty is baked into the system. It is a feature, not a bug. As long as we operate under a system that promotes making money AT ALL COSTS, we will have poverty. Why? Because LABOR is usually the biggest expense for any business. Therefore, business will always seek out ways to cut labor costs. It doesn't matter if that means taking advantage of software, robotics, or low wage workers in China and Mexico. Under our current capitalist system, cutting labor is GOOD because it decreases a businesses operating costs, increases profits and share value. Who cares if some people just lost their means to survive? ABSOLUTELY ZERO CEO's wake up in the morning and ask themselves \"how many jobs can I create today?\" Or \"how can I raise the standard of living for people today?\" THAT is the problem.
