This is no more than truth, although the left never tires of denying it, not willing to acknowledge that it all happened on President Obama's and Sec. of State Clinton's watches, not on Dubya's. Add to that error of judgment their willingness to allow Syria to disintegrate into a hideous civil war and you pretty much have the explanation for the rise of ISIS and its regional metastasis. We just didn't care enough about it to stop it when we could.<br/><br/>It was a pretty good speech, despite the editors' resolve to spin it as \"confused\". It sets out bones of contention between Trump's view, which is the overwhelming view of Republicans, and those of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, who understandably remain defensive.<br/><br/>But a presidential debate on national security would be an excellent opportunity to parse competing arguments. But some advice to Mrs. Clinton: if her argument, like Mr. Obama's, is that George W. Bush is to blame for everything bad on this Earth since Eve took a surreptitious bite of an apple, despite EIGHT YEARS of Obama stewardship, then she won't convince DEMOCRATS not already sold, forget about Republicans.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4712/3844/cropped-47123844.jpg?0.06419149620228637", "createDate": "1471334847", "commentID": 19502039, "userID": 47123844, "recommendations": 102, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19502039}, {"approveDate": "1471340925", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1471337325", "permID": "19502193", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 1, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 10, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Fort Worth, TX", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "nkda2000", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Every time I listen and try to rationally look at Trump\u2019s Foreign Policies, I come away more and more confused.
