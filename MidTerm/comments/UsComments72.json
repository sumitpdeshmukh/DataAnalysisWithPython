I've read that \"getting rid of money in politics\" pretty much universally makes it to the top 5 of voter wish lists.  <br/><br/>And yet, after two presidential candidate debates, it's been broached once and not followed up on.  Actually, had the Board not even mentioned this factoid, I'd assumed it hadn't been asked at all.<br/><br/>While I'm familiar with Clinton's main proposals, I wasn't aware of all her down in the weeds ideas for reforming campaign finance reform listed in this editorial.   And yes, while it's understandable how much voters remain skeptical about her intentions to follow through on this--given the breadth of her war chest and the documented fact that this campaign has been the costliest ever--I believe voters will hold her feet to the fire.  Given her unpopularity, if elected she will be on an extremely tight leash.<br/><br/>We know the GOP will do nothing about this, as their lifeblood is big-spending donors, documented as always outspending Democrats.  The main reason why the GOP continues to be unenthusiastically OK with a President Trump is their obsession with the Supreme Court--one that presumably will protect Citizens United, and thus their own re-election coffers.   <br/><br/>Maybe Chris Wallace will raise the issue again on Wednesday. I'd be interested in having him perhaps ask Mr. Trump why voters should trust him the best one to \"fix\" the \"rigged\" system of quid pro quo he claims to have exploited so well.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/2073/520/cropped-2073520.jpg?0.18587254704312467", "createDate": "1476571905", "commentID": 20148665, "userID": 2073520, "recommendations": 133, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 20148665}, {"approveDate": "1476621130", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1476633173", "permID": "20154255", "status": "approved", "trusted": 1, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 2, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Durham", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Frank", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Politicians who want to rein in the influence of big money in politics are faced with a dilemma that renders them open to the charge of hypocrisy:  campaign against Citizens United while accepting money from big donors.  Contradictory as it may appear, they have no way out.  They can depend on the small donations of their supporters while refusing to accept big money, as Sanders did.  The trouble is that our small donations are not sufficient to wage the two year costly battle to get elected. And  if you don't get elected, no amount of good intentions will bring about the desired goal.  The alternative is to campaign against the very system that allows you to campaign.  The solution is to dismantle the  preposterous idea that money is free speech.  What it is is power and in a democracy no one should have more power than anyone else.<br/>Meanwhile, politicians are being corrupted while lamenting their need to do so in order to survive.
