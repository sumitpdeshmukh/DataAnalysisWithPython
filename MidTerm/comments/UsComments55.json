Cameras everywhere tracking and recording, compiling analytics, online, phones, profiles on millions if not billions - take a step back and look at it objectively and it's terrifying as well as unnecessary.<br/><br/>19 men hijacked some planes with a small support staff. In reaction to that, we now are monitored 24/7 - across the globe with ever-increasing secrecy and complexity and by people who have routinely broken the few \"privacy laws\" still in place.<br/><br/>Security is certainly at stake, but it's security from the power of the government and its agents to peer into our lives and annotate what they find, not some mythic terrorist beast.
