Both my parents worked commission only sales jobs. They worked long days nights and weekends to make their sales goals. It fell to my sister and I to do school pick ups, doctor appointments, speech therapy sessions, and arrange sporting activities for our disabled younger autistic half brother. Once our brother reached the teenage years our parents could not decide on whether to medicate him or send him away to an alternative school. The family therapist had to make the decision that was putting extreme stress on the marriage and entire family. Every five years my parents had to make major decisions regarding my brothers long term care. Once he aged out of school at 21 he ended back at home in a local adult day care program. My parents could not decide on a group home for him. Having him at home long term had it's challenges once my mother came home from work to find our father in a medical emergency and my brother unable to telephone for help. My sister and I did our part but as adults we had careers, husbands and small children. Once our father past away it was clear our mother wasn't coping well. We encouraged her to move closer to her friends and family in Italy. Now she has companionship, a 24/7 adult boarding school for my brother and good quality free healthcare.
