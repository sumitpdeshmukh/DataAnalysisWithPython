He cynically calculated that the path to victory lay through a negative appeal to disaffected white Democrats from Dixie, angered by their party's transformation into a champion of civil rights.  Nixon's success encouraged Reagan to double down on the strategy.  The former actor camouflaged the vicious approach with a veneer of geniality and a promise of \"morning in America.\"  But the smile on Reagan's face could not conceal the message that the Democrats had victimized the white working class through unjust favoritism toward blacks.<br/><br/>The depiction of the Democrats as almost an illegitimate class-based party infected the GOP view of government.  The Dems had used state power to help the poor and minorities, so government itself had become unreliable, an enemy of the working class. Obama has simply reinforced this view. <br/><br/>Trump has embarrassed his party by candidly stating, in extreme form, the GOP's message of hostility to ethnic minorities as a threat to American values.

He may not get the minority vote , but he would get the majority of the independent vote &amp; the moderate Democrat vote, which will more than make up for the loss of the minorities, who would not vote Republican anyway.As a\u00a0life long Democrat I would vote for my fellow New Yorker Donald Trump.I must have touch a New York Times nerve, they won't let me submit my comments.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1449755160", "commentID": 16914301, "userID": 56907400, "recommendations": 14, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 16914301}, {"approveDate": "1449769481", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1449769481", "permID": "16916268", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "New Jersey", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Luomaike", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Part of me can accept that Trump\u2019s messaging appeals to the insecurities and fears of a certain portion of the electorate.
