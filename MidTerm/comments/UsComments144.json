There is plenty of time for Clinton II to lose. I have gone down with McGovern, Carter, Mondale, and all the rest of the down-tickets.  Hillary Clinton is NOT talking about ordinary jobs for ordinary people. Targeted tax cuts are stinkers and she remains very vulnerable.

He appears ignorant of the most fundamental parts of governance and he never expresses regret for any hurt he causes anyone.  Could America actaully elect someone who is potentially a sociopath or possibly even a psychopath?  It\u2019s bizarre to even ask the question but the possibility seens completely real.<br/>From MedicalDaily.com:  \u201cAccording to Dr. L. Michael Tompkins, a psychologist at the Sacramento County Mental Health Treatment Center, the difference lies in having a conscience. A psychopath simply doesn\u2019t have one, he told WebMD. They will steal from you without feeling a twinge of guilt \u2014 though they may pretend to if they\u2019re caught, so they aren\u2019t \u201cfound out.\u201d A sociopath, on the other hand, will understand that taking your money is wrong and may feel remorse, but it won\u2019t be enough to stop their deviant behavior. A psychopath has less regard for others than a sociopath.\u201d<br/>Unfortunately the description appears to fit.<br/>In this context Hillary is a very \u201cnormal\u201d person.  Definitely a politician, but she knows right from wrong, has a strong knowledge of governance and a sense of empathy.  There is a world of difference.  It\u2019s astonishing that Trump has got this far but people need to understand that he has an unstable personality and represents a real potential danger to America.. &amp; the world for that matter, and cannot get anywhere near the WH.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1471308385", "commentID": 19500538, "userID": 70110188, "recommendations": 13, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19500538}, {"approveDate": "1471345448", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1471341848", "permID": "19501495", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Manhattan", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Manderine", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Regardless if Hillary Clinton is ahead in the polls NOW, we need to remain focused, continue to register voters, connect ALL the down-ballot GOP candidates to Donald Trump, and most importantly...make sure that voters get out and vote on Election Day.<br/>While it looks good for Clinton, and very bad for trump now, and even though Trump is claiming the media is to blame for his low numbers, we can not trust it is over until it IS OVER and Hillary Rodham Clinton is the 45th president of the USA.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1471319260", "commentID": 19501495, "userID": 28588861, "recommendations": 12, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19501495}], "totalEditorsSelectionReturned": 0, "replyLimit": 3, "totalRecommendationsReturned": 24, "page": 1, "callerID": null, "totalReporterReplyCommentsReturned": 0, "filter": "", "totalCommentsFound": 426, "api_timestamp": "1488822433", "totalReplyCommentsFound": 208, "totalCommentsReturned": 25, "sort": "oldest", "totalReporterReplyCommentsFound": 0}, "debug": {"version": 3.1}}
