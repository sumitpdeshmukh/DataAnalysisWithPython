Trump's ideas sound outrageous but they are not much more than the application of existing policies, laws and enforcement tools. Solving the immigration issue in a way other than what Trump is proposing will require siginficant changes to policy and law. If our lawmakers cannot get a better grasp of the situation through modifications to and enforcement of our laws then the Trump agenda will remain, however awful, somewhat legitimate.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1472824941", "commentID": 19679561, "userID": 4385033, "recommendations": 11, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 19679561}, {"approveDate": "1472829456", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1472825856", "permID": "19680312", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Tulsa", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "DJ", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "If one listens carefully to his speech, the saddest part of Mr. Trump's deportation proposal is not that he wants to deport illegal aliens because they are here illegally.

He'll be told about having to first hire and train all these new people (requires new bureaucracy, facilities, etc.), Then coordination with existing authorities must be \"negotiated\". Of course Union contracts need to be renegotiated. Then we really need to wait for new prisons to be built and more guards hired and trained and since it's been privatized new government workers to audit and oversee operations. Oh the list is huge.
