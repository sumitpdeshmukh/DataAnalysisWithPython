President Obama chose advisers who did not always agree with him nor did they agree with one another, but they were all qualified and respected in their fields. I doubt if President Obama ever made any foreign policy decision without serious consultation with advisors on all sides of the question. His policies and actions were consistent with the values he espoused. We were never shocked at anything President Obama said or did.<br/><br/>If Mr. Trump becomes our commander-in-chief, President Obama will be sorely missed by conservatives, moderates and liberals alike.
