Going after a narrower and narrower appeal seems counter productive. The \"strategy\", if that word fits, is the opposite of what has been sought by American political parties for most of our history. <br/><br/>The normal way of doing things can be compared to a Christmas tree where the central structure and branches represent the broad strokes of wide appeal, with various ornaments hung on to get the votes of specific groups. Instead, the Republicans are ripping branches off the tree and pulling off ornaments, challenging people to stay with them.<br/><br/>The Republican party is still milking the combined dissatisfaction from the Great Recession and the failure of American jobs to sufficiently reward workers with increased pay. The massive problem they've built for themselves, however, was given rise by propagandistic media, like Fox News and talk radio, constantly stoking fear and anger. Trump stepped right into the arena built by right wing media and the extremist language embraced by tea party groups and newer members of Congress. They have cooked up a nasty pot of stew; they might yet cook in it themselves.<br/><br/>It would be further interesting to know how many Trump \"supporters\" aren't even registered to vote. There appears to be an interesting correlation in the mapping of high Trump support with areas of the country hit hardest by job losses and low wages.

Surely many of these districts contributed no respondents at all to the sample.  This is all \"statistical modeling\".  Mr Cohn has a history of being very good at this.  This particular venture doesn't make the cut.  I can only guess at what he did with his data.  I'd guess he used, age, sex, education, ethnicity (possibly just race and hispanic/non hispanic), maybe census tract home values, possibly religion. and some interaction terms with region.  <br/><br/>His confidence interval is 8.7%, meaning almost no district is different from the mean for all districts.
