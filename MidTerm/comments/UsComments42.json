He is uninformed and MIGHT rely on a few trusted agents, many of whom are as aggressive and pugilistic as he is.  Trump seems to have no clue as to the delicate balances we have regarding Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and the Middle East.  Managing these delicate balances is not at all like he may manage his businesses and his business relationships.
