After we had known each other for a long time, she described to me how she came to be here. It did not sound remotely easy, but did sound scary and difficult.  I consider her my friend. Our children played together, she went on vacation with us with her children. She and her husband worked very hard, saved almost every penny they earned, bought a home here, and one in Mexico for her mother to live in. Her 2 children were born here and both went to college. One is a physician in Mexico now because the tuition for medical school in Mexico is very affordable. The other is more American than Mexican and is attending college here. She applied for and was granted amnesty by RONALD REAGAN in the early 80's. She is now a full citizen of the USA. So here is just one story of an illegal immigrant who has contributed to our society, and still does. Her family pays taxes and are model Americans. They are not criminal or rapists Mr. Trump.<br/>We are all immigrants to this nation unless we are Native American. You don't look like an American Indian to me Mr. Trump.

Although the overwhelming majority of Americans are descendants of immigrants, their ancestors came to these shores at times where both land and low skilled jobs were plentiful, a situation that is nearing saturation in a matter of at best a few decades. To be successful in the long run- the proverbial American dream- requires the availability of affordable education- predominantly professional degrees from colleges and to a lesser extent skilled trades from community colleges. Sadly these paths are barely affordable to Americans and represent an extremely high barrier for children of unskilled immigrants, legal or otherwise. Unless we, as a society, commit ourselves to make education affordable to all, an ever increasing, poorly educated underclass -both native and immigrants- will be a social and moral dilemma for the nation. We certainly have flourished from the strength of our immigrants, but many of those of the past have been highly educated and could contribute to the economy or intellectual excellence from the day they arrived here. This form of immigration has abated, but we should nevertheless encourage this path more extensively, as the economic well being of most past contributing nations have now approached or even surpassed the US in income and opportunities.
