I assume you are a Jew as I am. I am fallen away big time and consider myself an aetheist. But when Trump made his announcement and dissed Mexicans, my conclusion was that an avowed racist is not qualified for the Oval Office. While the field of Republican hopefuls made criticizing him difficult, what rang the bell of his future, aside from great voter unrest with their lot in life, was the moral failure of both the opponents and the Republican party. When a prospective leader cannot disguise his bigotry, my fear is: We Jews are next. He opened the door to America first, nativism, fear of Muslims, and total negation of the Federal government. He even was quoted as saying that the little guys with hats he only trusted to count his money. That's badly disguised anti-Semitism and he opened the door to the disaffected at the very least distrusting Jews for the usual reasons down through the millenia, If you got it wrong about Trump's future, you overlooked his character deficiency as a self-blind narcissist.
