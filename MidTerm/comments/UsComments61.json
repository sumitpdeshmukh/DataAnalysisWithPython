Most gun victims -- those targeted by the alogirithm -- are among the least empowered of Americans.  When gun violence ventures into better neighborhoods, the residents march to Washington, get nowhere and then go back to their daily lives.  The commitment to gun control is pretty much all bark and no bite.  The law of the land is that gun ownership is a fundamental right of the people.  Scalia told us that that is how the colonists thought of it in 1789, so that's the way it is.  Constitutional originalism dictates our gun laws, but not much else.  A sustained effort to overturn Heller or repeal the Second Amendment is called for.  Abortion foes work tirelessly to get rid of Roe v Wade and, despite the fact that they're in the minority, they are precious close to success.  By comparison, gun control advocates are not committed.   The real problem is in the slums and the real power is in the suburbs and never the twain shall meet.  Why isn't there an anti-NRA?  Can you name one national gun control group?  When's the last time you donated to a gun control group?  Self-righteous outrage about guns and two dollars buys you a cup of coffee and nothing else.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4814/7869/cropped-48147869.jpg?1475980521793890914", "createDate": "1464255466", "commentID": 18645777, "userID": 48147869, "recommendations": 56, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 18645777}, {"approveDate": "1464259615", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1464271722", "permID": "18645989", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 6, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Hopewell Junction NY", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Cathy", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Overt racism is becoming OK again, but the quiet underlying racism is still more prevalent. <br/><br/>And nothing is more racist than our gun laws. You see it in comments over and over about black on black violence, as if it is not a problem as long as it is young black men killing other young black men, out of sight of more stable neighborhoods. That the victims are often collateral damage - kids on porches, or in living rooms, or playing basketball in a local park - well, that is something the black community should resolve. <br/><br/>We don't even, as a nation, try to limit illegal access to guns. We don't register sales. We don't manage gun inventories. We don't stop lax laws that allow interstate trafficking. Because, most likely those guns are just going to be used to have one gang member pick off another. <br/><br/>Just before Easter, a local young man - my son's age - was shot while standing with his friends, collateral damage when a group in a car demonstrated that they couldn't aim and didn't care. While I will get to see my son receive his diploma, this young man will most likely get a memorial at his high school graduation. And at least part of the reason is because a state like Georgia or South Caroline really didn't care if he ever made it to adulthood.
