Not only should immigration not be on the list, most of the fears on the list shouldn't be on the list. What I've noticed, especially since 2001, is that most GOP candidates for anything, tell the electorate that it should be afraid...very afraid. Yes, there's always the obligatory comment about making America great again, whatever that means. But, the thrust is about fear.<br/><br/>If a message, a lie, is repeated over and over, for a long time, it begins to embed itself, to take root, even among intelligent people. Even those who don't really believe the lie(s) begin to wonder whether they've missed something...\"maybe everyone else is right. Maybe I should fear this or that\". <br/><br/>Instead of speaking about things like hopes, aspirations, dreams, equality, tolerance, acceptance, etc., the GOP speaks to the reptilian portion of our brain stems...the place where our basest emotions have rested for eons.

There's a reason Republicans constantly attack her but praise Bernie, and it's not because they like what Bernie stands for.  <br/><br/>I don't know how old you are, but I remember the Clinton years.  They were the most stable &amp; prosperous years of my adult life.  Hillary worked to reform healthcare and promote women's rights.  Those good years ended with 9/11 and Bush's wars for oil.  Hillary is a lot smarter and stronger than that -- she'll be a good president &amp; appoint justices like Kagan or Sotomayor.  If a Republican appoints more Scalias, none of your goals will be realized in our lifetimes.<br/><br/>Please, you can love Bernie without hating the Clintons.  I like Bernie too, but he hasn't yet been tested in southern states or against the Republican character shredder.  So please, don't trash Clinton and her supporters -- we need them,<br/>because this project goes far beyond Bernie.  The nation is so divided that change will take many years.  We have to vote for Democrats in every local, state &amp; national election, work on campaigns, run for local and state office, or recruit others to run...and finally, not alienate potential supporters who don't fully share the vision.
