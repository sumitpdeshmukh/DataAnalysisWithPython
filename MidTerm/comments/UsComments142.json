Of course there are going to be some of these (there's some of almost anything), but for me to accept that it is a significant force in the election, I would need to see data.  I don't see convincing data in Cohn's article here: He cites that, among white people without college degrees, \"[i]n recent national surveys, Mr. Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 59 percent to 30 percent\" while Romney lead Obama by 57 to 35 percent.   Given the imprecision in polling and the greater uncertainty in this election compared to 2012 (including, significantly, much greater third-party participation and more undecided voters), I do not see a convincing case supporting the proposition that a significant  number of Obama supporters have switched to Trump.  It may be true, but it seems to be supposition at this point.  Obviously, once the votes have been cast in this election we'll have a clearer picture.  Right now, though, the data seems inconclusive (at least as it is presented by Cohn), as well as the proposition seeming counter-intuitive (from the perspective of one of those notorious coastal elites).", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1478463025", "commentID": 20376927, "userID": 57238287, "recommendations": 28, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 20376927}, {"approveDate": "1478462829", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1478459229", "permID": "20376910", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 1, "replies": [{"approveDate": "1478467081", "commentType": "userReply", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1478463481", "permID": "20376910:20377051", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": "LCG", "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 2, "userLocation": "North Carolin", "parentID": 20376910, "userDisplayName": "StarSword-C", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Point of order, more Democrats voted for George Bush than voted for Nader.
