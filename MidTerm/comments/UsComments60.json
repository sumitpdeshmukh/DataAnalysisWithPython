For President-elect Trump, worst scenario, what if half his nominations are not confirmed? If we have grid-lock \"government\" at the starting line, will the government go anywhere? The corollary, if all the nominations go through and the advocated policy is to say no to everything positive accomplished in the last 8 years, then will the government go anywhere? When a 2 year old throws a temper tantrum and says no to everything, the child learns both the power of \"no\" and the reality of deprivation. It is easy to say \"no\" and deprive; any 2 year-old can do that. It takes more maturity to share and be fair and exercise citizenship with all citizens in mind. I have written this before because it has become like a mantra for me, in the pledge of allegiance to the United States Flag we say it stands for \"liberty and justice for all\".

We used to understand that a necessary balance needs to exist.  Under Republican greedthink this goes out the window and is why under Republican administrations for the past 30 years the nation as a whole does not do well.  When you spend government money as on wars without taxing for it or when you cut government spending at a time of weakish consumer spending you set off a negative economic spiral within the nation, and workers whose incomes have been essentially flat for 20 years are not in a position to fill the loss in the economy.  That is what has happened in Kansas and other Republican states which have followed this economically ignorant practice.  But Rs don't believe in reality until it hits their 1%, which is to say not until a depression sets in.
