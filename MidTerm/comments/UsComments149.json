Canadian's watched this election with more interest than usual; mainly based on the fear of Trump becoming president.

It was like a bunch of drunk guys in a frat on a Saturday night voting for the loudest, most boorish person they could find. The American systems needs an overhaul. 600 days of campaigning is ridiculous. People loose site of what is important. In Canada we had a lengthy 11 week campaign. The most important issue of our time being that of climate change is going to be relegated to the back burner as the right wing close minded republicans take control. The state of the Earth will continue its downward spiral. The Grand Old Party needs to rebuild itself. It is not the 1800's anymore. It is time to become a Grand New Party and move forward and deal with the important issues today. Unfortunately that requires a global understanding of issues and considering uneducated whites put Trump into power I don't see things changing. Again the candidate with the most votes did not win.

There is no quick fix to the problem of white voter miseducation and bigotry, but the first step is recognizing the problem.  As a white person, I'm speaking to other caucasians. Let's get real.  We are the biggest problem.  Fixing this starts with us.  Everyone plays a role, but we play the worst role.  Sexism, homophobia, racism, religious intolerance and failure to affirm diversity.  As hard as I try, the older I get and the more I learn, the more I realize times when I perpetuate these ills, even in subtle ways.  In fact, it is usually when we think we have none of these traits that we are the worst of them.  We are also probably the biggest contributors to destroying our planet.  We have blood on our hands and it is time to look inward at what we are doing.  So I'm committing today, to check myself, every morning, on all of these issues.  Am I contributing to the problem?  If so, how?  I'm going to keep doing this until I can become carbon neutral and hopefully a better fellow human being.<br/>Please join me.
