The majority of colleges in this country should be shut down.  For Profit colleges must be reined in immediately!  Why isn\u2019t it done?  One answer is surprisingly simple: if you close the college, you close the town; not unlike obsolete military bases and underutilized post offices.  Politicians lack the intelligence, integrity, fortitude and foresight to enlighten their constituencies and pursue visionary, long term alternatives to sustain their social and economic well being.  Students and their beleaguered parents are being tragically misled so that we can meet the short term goal of keeping students off the streets and providing college-related jobs in many struggling communities which have no other viable sources of income.  The vilest tragedy is not the waste of the taxpayer\u2019s dollar.  It is the virtually inevitable shattering of the hopes and dreams of students and their families while saddling them with a lifetime of insurmountable debt that they can never repay because they have not been taught the skills to get a job which will allow them to do so.

FDR was smart enough and charismatic enough to know how to save the capitalist system from either communism or fascism, which were real possibilities in the US in those days.  This time it is Mr. Trump who has the charisma, not, say Ms. Clinton, who may be as smart as FDR was, but doesn't connect with masses of people in the same way.
