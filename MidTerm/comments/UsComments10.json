And that is that Bill Clinton had said things to him on the golf course that were allot worse. It would also not be unfair to assume that Clinton too was referring to actions of his, just as Trump was.<br/>And the fact is that if a recording of Clinton talking that same manner of \"locker room talk\" came to light, or if somebody that had heard him speaking that way decided to tell the public about it, we would not as a nation completely reassess who Clinton is and was, or retroactively downgrade his whole presidency. In fact since these revelations would not be in regard to a presidential candidate they would not even be major news, as it would not come as a surprise to most people.<br/>And the same is true about Trump. That while it merits being \"major news\" to be discussed and dissected by the media because of its relevance to the presidential race, most people are not all surprised by it at all. Just about anyone who hears of this views it as as a story about a recording surfacing at one of the worst possible moments in what is the game of the race for president.<br/>That the significance this holds for most Americans is all in the recording being discovered is a game changer in an exciting competition that has the nation is focused on.
