Back in 2002, as the local union president, I negotiated a health insurance plan that involved a pre-taxable income payroll deduction and an employer contribution to the HSA, which is a tax-sheltered savings account. Thus, the tax savings were in three different places. Not only that, but the HSA earns interest (and is transferable if one changes employers). The employer was able to save money EVEN WITH the employer contribution because the higher deductible plan was so much cheaper. As a consumer, I also had a cheaper premium. The only real problem is that it takes a little bit of time to build the HSA up enough to cover the deductible - if you have a catastrophic event during that interim, it will be financially difficult, so that's a risk. I also support the idea that consumers should be aware of the actual market costs of their health care, something that paying a high deductible promotes. This helps drive overall costs down.

Obamacare is the only thing that has made health insurance affordable for my family the past 2 years.  We are all set for next year, too, but I am terrified that insurance for low income (not poor) people will disappear come 2018.  How is it possible that Republicans have any credibility with any voters when they've promised \"replace\" again and again but have never actually designed a feasible alternative?", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1480338289", "commentID": 20626053, "userID": 17816509, "recommendations": 111, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 20626053}, {"approveDate": "1480351925", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1480351925", "permID": "20626005", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 0, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 1, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": true, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Arcata, CA", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Humboldt County", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "According to the Economist, Commonwealth Fund, Kaiser and others, we spend $9,086 per person annually on health care while Switzerland, the second-highest-spending country, spent $6,325, and the rest go down from there.

Simple I'm a life long proponent of prolife policies as they relate to abortion, euthanasia, consumer protection, work place rules, environmental protection, social security and public health.

Probably not, but not for reasons having to do with his preferences or his intentions. The typical American voter is about \"ME\", and once all the dust is settled, people will invariably engage in a self serving somewhat misinformed benefit-cost analysis to ascertain what is and is not to their advantage. Once again, public policy will be sifted on the basis of self interest salted with a good measure of demagoguery. <br/><br/>Both parties are aware of this and will seek to exploit the current and erstwhile emerging political divide to assure reelection.
