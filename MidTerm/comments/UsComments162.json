If all the women who have been assaulted by Trump continue to speak out and make clear to all republicans that this man is simply unacceptable as a symbol of our country...maybe...just maybe they will overcome their hatred of liberals, democrats, etc and refuse to vote for this truly repellant individual.

But, unless big money has control of this country which it does via the bought and paid for Republican Party, big money would be certain to lose certain amounts of money if the Democrats come into control of the US government.  Also, having control of the presidency would have a trickle down affect for other key positions in our government, such as the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>So, first of all, it is imperative that the Republicans acquire and maintain control of the US government.

But to leave Trump in office will lead to the inevitable collapse of the known world.  So Trump would have to go away\u2026somehow!  With Trump on a permanent hiatus, that would then leave the next in line for the presidency and of course that would be whoever is in the Vice President slot\u2026Pence.  President Pence.
