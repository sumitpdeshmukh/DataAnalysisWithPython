From what I get from my right-wing pen-pals and friends, there are three main reasons this abuse is acceptable.  First is that The Chicken Hawks that make up such a large percentage of the GOP are, on some deep level, aware that their belligerence is equaled only by their reluctance to serve.  It's why they went after Kerry in such a big way about his service; and why they don't respect McCain for his.   McCain is just a tortured reminder of past military failure.  And he doesn't even want to water board the 'Perfidious Muslims\". Second are those who did serve, and have always regarded the Senator as \"The Admiral's Boy\" an incompetent screw-up who caused the loss of several perfectly good aircraft (and probably the USS Forrestal fire). Third, are the ones who just don't care, because Mr. Trump so clearly enunciates their gut obsessions on the subject of \"Dark People Who Are Ruining Our Country\". (Though not how they put it, that is what they really mean). Their opinions are not moderated by reality, nor by reason.  In any case, I would be startled if Mr. Trump' numbers fell below 20% of the GOP vote; unless he starts moderating his stance.

So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre \u2014 the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal.
