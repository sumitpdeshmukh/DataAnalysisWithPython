I think this philosophical divide between the two political camps goes all the way back to our early colonial period where the Whigs (Democrats) and the Tories (Republicans) were the principal political parties. The Whigs favored a democracy where power was distributed and not centralized in a single authority; the Tories, on the other hand, favored a more authoritarian style and remained loyal to the King of England.

States and localities with more conservative social laws are superceded by Obama-type regulations that accompany any federal funding.
