Donald Trump is a kind of political Dr. Phil. He gives them the opportunity to vent deep disappointment, frustration, &amp; resentment. His candidacy is a collective catharsis. His rallies are not about policy; they're about being heard: The supporters I know simply don't feel heard, not by me, not by our leaders. And unfortunately they don't engage in civil discourse or civic life because the work of life - houses, jobs, kids, health - is enormously weighty.

I looked over and her sign had been torn down, and a group of tall plainclothes rough men surrounded her, but all facing the stage. She looked scared.
