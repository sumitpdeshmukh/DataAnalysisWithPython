Imagine all the Republicans who are actually more dangerous than Trump, they are real politicians who have passed laws. Trump may hog all the bluster, but it is Mike Pence who has done actual damage.

Take a look at what Cruz has done in Texas, and Rubio in Florida. <br/><br/>These guys may appear like milquetoasts compared with The Donald, but they are the sly sneaky ones who effect legislation.
