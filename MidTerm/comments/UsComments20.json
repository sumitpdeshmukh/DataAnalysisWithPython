Liberals wanting to make immigration a referendum on whether or not you're a xenophobe is as silly as when conservatives seek to make raising or lowering taxes a measure of whether you're for freedom or tyranny. <br/><br/>Immigration policy that focuses on the right skill sets in proper proportions helps make our economy more dynamic and our country more diverse. But too much stifles wages, tears at social cohesion, and puts enormous economic stress on small communities and lower classes. Calling for a reduction in immigration levels is not the same thing as being against immigration, and is certainly not the same thing as calling for a suspension of all immigration.  <br/><br/>You can't claim to be fighting for working people at the same time you're flooding communities with low skill labor from outside the country's borders. The economic mobility of those people who work with their hands for a living or lack college education will be stymied by this onslaught. It never ceases to amaze me how people can wrap their heads around \"outsourcing\" jobs to another country where labor is cheaper, but can't understand how rampant immigration, legal or otherwise, accomplishes the same feat.<br/><br/>I'm against drowning, too, but that doesn't make me anti-water.

While the shop had not been profitable for decades, they didn't close it until many of the employees were ready to retire. Their management style is clearly not brilliant. Capitalism dictates that when the business is no longer competitive, it should be restructured or shuttered and resources, including humans, should be deployed elsewhere to maximize efficiency. For small business, human relationship often prevails over efficiency. Clearly, our multinational cooperation today operates very differently. The mantra is that the executives must fulfill their fiduciary duty to the shareholders. This is very reasonable given that they are only hired to manage shareholder's money. I think that here lies the dilemma with large modern corporation. They are very efficient but treat employee no better than a clog in the machine. Mom and Pop businesses are humane but will never be competitive in today's world. One answer is clearly labor unions that protects the right of the workers. A complementary answer lies in rethinking and restructuring the mandate for corporate executives; it may not be radical for society to dictate that the responsibilities of company executive may lie beyond that of the shareholders but also the welfare of the employees and the local community. Both these changes will somewhat reduce economic efficiency but maximizing economic efficiency is not the only measure of social good as my parents knew.
