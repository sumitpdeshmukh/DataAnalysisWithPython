Of course, these poseurs don't really care what the NYT says and, worse, use its editorials and comments to solidify their positions with their bases. I support the president's measured words and actions. Still, I understand what I suspect is a near-universal desire to see some type of meaningful if not decisive action. The dissatisfaction with his recent speech stems from its \"stay the course\" theme and lack of a particular action directly focussed on ISIL and its nominal base of operations. Continuing air sorties and infrastructure destruction are necessary, but they're too subtle for many, don't produce dramatic short-term results and don't capture the popular imagination. The GOP candidates' professed actions are absurd, empty, immoral and likely illegal, but they are dramatic actions nonetheless. (And, yes, Mr. Bush, I do think that extremist Christians are a threat to Western civilization.) What one action could the president take that would clearly harm ISIL and rally popular support? Perhaps the recent successful raid that freed ISIL prisoners is a decent example. The additional SOF capabilities recently committed may be a basis or source for the kind of action that I think most Americans would cheer. I trust the president and his advisers are open and alert to opportunities to damage ISIL without dragging the US further into the Middle East quagmire.
