Trump bails and Pence becomes president, repaying many-fold the funds invested in the campaign.  Two, within months Trump wanders into an impeachable offense permitting the Republican Party, \"with a heavy heart\", to remove him from office for the good of the country, proclaiming their nobility for dumping their own man. In fact it puts a trustworthy conservative in the Presidency, enabling them to pack the Supreme Court, further voter suppression, wage an aggressive culture war, and undo the Iran nuclear deal, not to mention further ravage the safety net. Trump has prepared the way to be out of office by the end of 2017, returning to the business world with the permanent title of \"Mr. President\". The only uncertainty is whether he did all this by cunning design or whether it was an error in judgment he will recoup by proclaiming political bankruptcy.
