Sometimes wildly wrong.<br/><br/>The first and best reason is that people no longer have home phones, and they don't answer their cell phone if they don't know who is calling. That makes pollsters desperate for respondents, and they then have to select responses from insignificant constituencies, or else they just make stuff up. Prime example of that is Romney not even writing a concession speech in 2012 because his pollsters kept telling him he was ahead by 6-7 points right up to election day, when Obama pummeled him. If you watched Turd Blossom's reaction on Fox News when Ohio reported in, you could see how wrong his pollsters were. Epic failure.<br/><br/>The second reason is more visceral. People simply don't feel an obligation to tell pollsters the truth. Whether it's because they are embarrassed by their choices, or want to make the pollsters look stupid because they've really, really had enough with being interrogated, they just lie. I know people who do that for fun. No way for pollsters to determine that or account for it.<br/><br/>Some stunning recent examples of polls gone wildly wrong: The British national election, and the Canadian national election, both of which were utterly, totally, completely miscalled by just about every polling outfit in both countries.
