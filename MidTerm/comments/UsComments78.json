Some other people should also be included like Snowden and Manning  to name just 2 more. Yet, in 8 years, I can't think of a single instance where Obama showed any mercy or compassion toward anyone who \"broke the law\" or \"made a mistake\" - nor anyone suffering through hard times, or foreclosed on or buried in student loan debt or literally unable to get the medical care they needed when they needed it. <br/><br/>Yes, more recently he's signed on for some clemency of some fortunate people.  I wonder how much of that has to do with his shaky legacy in the waning days of this disappointing presidency. <br/><br/>No, in 8 years, Obama has looked upon his subjects in the U.S. antiseptically, scoldingly, determining if people were quite worthy enough for help or aid and then it might come in some form in time, down the line, incrementally.  In addition there has always been the political calculation - as with gay marriage. If it serves him politically or in the eyes of the folks he hangs out with who might care about liberal issues, then maybe he'll step it up, but I wouldn't hold my breath.<br/><br/>I hold out little hope that he'll do anything of any great import on the side of justice or morality.  He's shown an aversion during most of his presidency to actions based on those very things. Talks about it, but does little if anything.
