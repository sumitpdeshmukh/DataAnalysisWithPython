When a Master Persuader does it, you are seeing pacing and leading.<br/><br/>a. Trump paced his base by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Once he had his base on his side emotionally, he led to them to his current policy of deporting only the people who committed crimes while here. Have you heard any Trump supporters complain about it lately?<br/><br/>b. Trump paced his base by saying he would ban all Muslim immigration to stop terrorist infiltration. Once he had them on his side emotionally, he led them first to a ban on specific problem countries, and then again to \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d which is a lot like Clinton\u2019s plan. Trump supporters followed, and you don\u2019t hear them complaining.<br/><br/>c. Early in the primaries Trump paced the racists in the Republican party by not disavowing them as clearly and as loudly as even the racists thought he would. Since then he has led Republicans to think that some form of a \u201cNew Deal\u201d for African-Americans might be worth a look.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Trump might be the safest president we have ever had. He can lead the dark parts of his base toward the light (as Nixon went to China) and he has no incentive for war.
