But, as a career prosecutor I believe this editorial badly misses the mark.  There are voter id laws in more than half the states, many of which have Democrat attorneys general.  If they care to, these State AG's can bring more lawsuits against voter id laws than the Justice Department, and they probably will.  If Sessions wants to focus on non-existent voter fraud, that seems like a good idea to me.  He'll get nowhere fast.  As for criminal justice reform, that is the work of Congress, not the AG.  Too many nonviolent drug cases are a ridiculous policy, but such cases almost all are tried in local courts, before and after Holder's reform. Finally, immigration cases --other than illegal re-entry -- are overseen by Homeland Security, not the Department of Justice.  So Sessions has a very limited role.<br/><br/>The greatest harm that Sessions can cause is by not approving cases which should be brought and cannot be brought by the states.  And, secondly, by bringing cases that are losers for political reasons.  If he does this, he will demoralize many career Justice employees, who may well leave in large numbers.  <br/><br/>I have said this a million times.  The Editorial Board needs a lawyer.
