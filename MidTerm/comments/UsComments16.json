In a misguided effort to be fair and balanced, every story about a politician had to have \"the other side\" represented.  In the most recent election, every time there was a negative story about Trump, some media types felt they had to at least explain to us again that Hillary was far from flawless or (often) bring up her email server. Negative had to be matched with negative; negative Trump Foundation story needed corresponding Clinton Foundation story (never mind that the former was a veritable slush fund and the latter a highly rated charity)... In that model, false equivalents are readily made - Trump is heard talking about freely availing himself of women's crotches, so we must mention that when Hillary was a cheated-on wife publically humiliated on the world stage she stood by her husband (the hussy)... <br/><br/>It is clear that I am a fan of this paper and other media sources that are, IMHO, good sources - still, y'all can and should do much better.
