When Steve Bannon is given as much power inside the White House as Reince Priebus, an honorable (if uninteresting) man even if he is an ideologue, then a major reset is necessary.<br/><br/>One asks why the new president values Mr. Bannon so highly? It cannot be that he is steady and clear and deliberative; a man who subscribes to the partnership between governing and the governing through the usual lens of \"we may have our differences but we're all Americans.\" This is what W., and his father before him, or even Ronald Reagan or Gerald Ford, or (gulp!) Richard Nixon, may have thrown out after their electoral victories. Donald Trump's employment of Mr. Bannon in the corridors of power will have the same effect as a serrated knife: cutting and deeply divisive. One would be a fool to imagine that the president-elect doesn't for a moment know what he's doing.<br/><br/>Given Mr. Trump's ignorance about the federal government, one might expect him to lean heavily upon the already-entrenched bureaucrats and lobbyists on K.

First, most of the people who Trump is looking at (Bannon, the hardcore racist, misogynist, and anti-Semite notwithstanding) are the very elite DJT said he would drain the swamp of.   Witness his turning to almost all inside-the-beltway establishment people from Congress or the K street lobbies for his transition team and his choice of ultimate establishment insider Reince Priebus as the second most powerful man in the government. Second, Trump is not a mere Molotov Cocktail, but a suitcase nuke with a very hinky trigger.
