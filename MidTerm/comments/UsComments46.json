How many times do we have to witness this behavior before it is officially recognized by the media?  <br/><br/>Secondly, Trump does what pleases his immediate audience.  With his appointments, he has surrounded himself with the most right wing, anti-government people available.  They are the most anti-labor, anti-environment, anti-healthcare, anti-regulation, anti-tax, anti-education bunch of right wingers imaginable.  What all of them want to do is cut spending.  They live for reducing federal spending.  It's all on the chopping block.

He is so happy that he will finally get to do what he has always wanted more than anything.  He wants to be the guy that voucherizes federal entitlement spending.
