There are debts to be paid and participants have assumed responsibility for those debts based on those binding contracts. You can't just tear them up. Getting out of one hotel building deal would take a lot of work. Some properties would likely have to be disposed of at fire sale prices. <br/><br/>Then there are the many licensing deals. People paid big chunks of money upfront to get the Trump name on their hotel and building. How do you back away? Most likely, there are continuing payments due as well, which means there are forward looking years of mutual obligations. Trump is not one to give up income streams lightly and, after all, those streams are there so his family can take over and keep the whole thing pumping money for the next 100 yrs., or however long they can sustain it.<br/><br/>Trump should have started cutting his ties two yrs. ago and had an active plan to complete it if he were elected.
