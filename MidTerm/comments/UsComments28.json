That agency is responsible for dozens of environmental matters.  Pruitt is the former Attorney General of Oklahoma.  He prosecuted civil and criminal cases.  I do not believe he ever brought a single action against the EPA.  He joined some other Republican AG's in a couple of relevant cases, gave an interview to the National Review that addressed climate change and a couple of related matters.  That's about it.  He probably knows nothing or next to nothing about environmental science, or the environment itself.  The big story isn't the few statements he's made.  It's the lack of knowledge on his part.  If he is approved, his only relevant view is that fewer regulations are better than more.  Administering an agency with an eraser, but no pencil, is rank incompetence.

And many people's livelihoods depend on those coal-fired power plans and the energy it supplies.  In fact, Hillary lost in every state that is either a major coal producer or uses coal for a significant portion of its power.<br/><br/>Look at California as the eptiome of the liberal vision.  They already have a law in place to source 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020.  Keep in mind that the cost of coal is $87 / Mwh vs solar at between $98 and $174 / Mwh.  That increased cost not only means high electricity bills for consumers.  It also means fewer manufacturing and other jobs that rely heavily on power. <br/><br/>I take no issue with the need to keep our air and water clean.  I am the father of four.
