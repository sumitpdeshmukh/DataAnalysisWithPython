But I believe there are some Willie Horton or a little girl pulling petals off a daisy still to come. One will most likely be a speech by Donald Trump ,where you can replace his comments on Muslims with alternative groups such as Jews,Catholics, African Americans, Italian Americans ,etc.,etc. Another is that Millania's 1995 photographs will become a part of a campaign strategy to maintain a white male voter base. Or that Millania will face scrutiny over getting paid for work not allowed by her visa. Or Jane Doe's accusations will come to light via the Epstein/Trump connection. People are beginning to block out any thing Mr. Trump has to say,having cried wolf one too many times. Hopefully the trend continues,people are having serious doubts. The change in the electorate is that Hillary is human. That Putin &amp; Julian Assange are definitely against Hillary because she has challenged them,as well as Trump. That some enemies are good to have,and Americans prefer Hillary,for simply the enemies she has made. Bernie Sanders didn't lose,he now has a commitment as we all should to fight our common enemies. The Democrats are the party of WE,not the Republican Party of ME,that Trump personifies. My trophy wife,my trophy family, my trophy business,my trophy supporters. So let's buy Mr. Trump a trophy after the election, so he can carry it around for all to view. Leave the brass plate blank,since he will write what it was for.
