Now, I realize that there can be issues with this, when one party dominates.  However, the majority of Californians share the same values; an attempt to create a egalitarian society, to keep our citizens safe, promote equality under the law, and the opportunity to get an education and become a productive citizen.  Yes, we have our issues and I'm not painting a utopia, however, I am proud to live in a state that continues to lead the country a number of important issues.", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "createDate": "1477626415", "commentID": 20274428, "userID": 66245524, "recommendations": 12, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "recommendedFlag": null, "commentSequence": 20274428}, {"approveDate": "1477626007", "commentType": "comment", "userTitle": "NULL", "updateDate": "1477622407", "permID": "20274410", "status": "approved", "trusted": 0, "sharing": 1, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "replyCount": 0, "replies": [], "editorsSelection": false, "timespeople": 1, "depth": 1, "userLocation": "Bel Air, MD", "parentID": null, "userDisplayName": "Aravinda", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "We went to hear Clinton and Kaine speak in Philadelphia, along with some of the local candidates.<br/>I went along with a group of climate activists and we were pleased to hear Josh Shapiro talk about environmental issues and being tough on the fracking industry to safeguard the water for the people of Pennsylvania.<br/>There was a lot of energy there and it would be good to see it settle this election in favour of sanity and decency at last.

Initially I lived in Erie, in the Northwestern part of the state. It was a heavily Catholic, conservative, Democratic, blue collar area at the time, which repeatedly sent Republican Tom Ridge, a native son, to Congress and then to the Governor's Mansion in Harrisburg. I now live in what is considered the South Central area of the state, a hot bed of hatred, bigotry and intolerance, populated by people helplessly watching as their communities are overrun by non-whites (the city's school district is more than 80 percent non-white) and what was once a manufacturing culture turns to one largely powered by the healthcare industry. The landscape is littered with Trump signs, as well as those screaming \"Hillary Belongs in Jail,\" as they continue a long-standing tradition of voting against their self-interests. They are ripe for the hatred and intolerance spread by Trump, and the fears he exploits. Many of them are also the \"poorly educated\" Trump has said he \"loves.\" Thank God for the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, as well as the suburban areas which surround them populated by the college educated white voters, the black voters and the women who are largely responsible for Clinton's lead in the state. As Trump and his Breitbart cohorts try every dirty trick and lie in the book to steal the election, it is those voters who are poised to give Clinton the state.
